# Black Jack

My Black Jack app is a desktop application that lets you play Black Jack with multiple players simultaneously. You will be able to create an account and login. Once signed in you will be able to join a table and start playing. Only fake money is used in this application and you will start with 1000$. When you run out of money, you can refill your account balance with an other 1000$.

Techniques/frameworks/etc. to be used in the Black Jack app.
* Express.js
* Socket.io
* MongoDB
* Electron
* React

The Black Jack app will consist of two parts, a server and a client. So far I have only started to work on the server.
